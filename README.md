This project is a **proof of concept (POC)** to explore the possibilities of integrating IoT devices and other interfaces with the **myApps** environment.

## 🔍 Purpose

The goal of this project is to demonstrate simple interactions using physical or virtual buttons within a myApps-based solution. Possible use cases include:

- IoT Integration (Buttons, Motion-, Open/Close - Sensors)
- User interaction via Hotkey
- Automations within the myApps ecosystem

## 💡 What's Included?

- Example code for IoT signal integration
- Connection to the myApps API / environment
- UI components to simulate button input
- Interact with other Apps like "Connect, Working,...).
